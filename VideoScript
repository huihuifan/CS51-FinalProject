Hi, I'm Vincent, and today I'll be introducing our CS51 final project.

Meet George, a new small business owner. George has always loved ramen, and recently opened a new ramen restaurant. It's slowly been picking up popularity and now is booming! That's great for George, but now he needs help keeping all of his records organized. 

The number of receipts George needs to organize is growing, and he wants to digitize them by scanning them into a computer and having his computer automatically read the handwritten numbers.

He goes to consult Angela and Andre's machine learning startup to get help on his problem. Angela and Andre introduce George to a machine learning procedure called the Neural Network.

A Neural Network is a family of learning algorithms based on the structure of neurons in the human brain. The idea is that neurons take input from a variety of sources, consolidate the data, and output a signal if the threshold is high enough. In Machine Learning, we want to imitate the neuron system to help distinguish signal from noise.

Neural networks function by using many neurons- shown here as the blue circles- to process the data and produce signal- shown here as the lines. The neural network stacks multiple layers of neuron nodes on top of each other, and the layers signal to each other.

For our project, we implemented a specific kind of neural network, called a Restricted Boltzmann Machine, or RBM. An RBM has two layers- a visible layer, and a hidden layer. Iteratively, the RBM learns weights, or values that represent how each node in the visible layer affects the hidden layer, and vice versa. Our RBM contains a bias layer as well, which allows the hidden and visible layer nodes to have a unique offset.

We started by training our RBM on a toy dataset to understand what kind
